# NeverBeLate Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 28, 2025**

## Overview

NeverBeLate ("the App") is a smart alarm app that helps you never miss your train by calculating wake-up times based on live Deutsche Bahn (DB) train schedules. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device
- **Commute Settings**: Start station, destination station, desired arrival times, and preparation times you configure
- **Alarm History**: Records of alarm adjustments made due to train delays
- **User Preferences**: Your safety buffer settings and enabled days

**This data is stored only on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not have access to this data and cannot retrieve it.**

### Data Sent to Third Parties
- **Deutsche Bahn API (v6.db.transport.rest)**: When you configure a commute, the App sends station IDs and desired arrival times to the public DB transport API to fetch train schedules and live delay information. This is a public, community-maintained API.

## Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number)
- We do not collect location data
- We do not use analytics or tracking
- We do not share data with advertisers
- We do not require account creation

## Permissions Used

### Notifications
Required to wake you up at the calculated alarm time.

### Background App Refresh
Used to periodically check for train delays and update your alarm time.

### AlarmKit (iOS 26+)
Used to schedule alarms that can wake you even when your phone is on silent mode.

## Data Security
All data is stored locally on your device. Communications with the DB transport API use HTTPS encryption.

## Your Rights
Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **Delete your data**: Simply delete the app or clear app data in Settings
- **Export your data**: Data viewable within the app settings

## Children's Privacy
The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date.

**Summary**: NeverBeLate stores your commute settings locally on your device. It only connects to the public DB transport API to fetch train schedules. We don't collect, store, or sell your personal data.
